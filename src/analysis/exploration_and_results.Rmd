# Data exploration
Inside Airbnb is a website dedicated to transparency and research on short-term rentals, specifically those listed on Airbnb. They use scraping methods to gather publicly available information form the Airbnb website. The data offers insights on various aspects of Airbnb listings of major cities all over the world. Consequently, it allows users to analyze trends, explore data, and conduct relevant researches.

### Inside Airbnb data
For the purpose of this research, the data sets is obtained on the website **http://insideairbnb.com/**. The data set is a collection of information on Airbnb listings in the city of Amsterdam, London, and Tokyo. The data sets are in the form of CSV files and contain information on the listings, reviews, and calendar of the listings. The data sets are collected on the 2nd of March 2024.

### Variables
The data sets contain a number of variables that are relevant to the research. 
In the table below, an overview of all relevant variables to the research is given with a brief definition.

Variable | Definition | Type of Data
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Price | daily price in local currency | Metric
Price_per_night | average price per night in local currency | Metric
minimum_nights | minimum number of night stay for the listing | Metric
Short-stay | number of nights stay for the listing (<7 nights) | Metric
Long-stay | number of nights stay for the listing (>= 7 nights) | Metric
review_scores_rating | average review score of the listing (0-5) | Metric
room_type | type of room (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room, Hotel) | Categorical

# Raw data exploration
Exploratory data analysis was conducted on the raw datasets representing Amsterdam, Tokyo, and London. Key variables were selected for visualization to enhance data interpretation within the research context.

## Number of listings across the cities
The figure below shows the distribution of Airbnb listings across the cities of Amsterdam, Tokyo, and London. This would help to understand the number of listings available in each city. The bar chart reveals a clear trend that Amsterdam exhibits the lowest number of listings, followed by Tokyo, with London demonstrating the highest listings.

## Stay length distribution
Given the research's focus on price discrepancies between varying stay lengths, it is crucial to examine the distribution of stay length across the cities. The bar chart below shows the distribution of short-stay and long-stay listings in Amsterdam, Tokyo, and London. The chart reveals that the majority of listings in all cities are short-stay listings.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../output/stay_category_distribution.png")
```

## Room type distribution
The distribution of room types across the cities is essential for understanding the variety of listings available to Airbnb users. The bar chart below illustrates the distribution of room types in Amsterdam, Tokyo, and London. The chart shows that the majority of listings accros all cities are "entire home/apartment" and "Private room" listings.

# Analysis and interpretation of results
The research aims to analyze the relationship between pricing discrepancies on short-stay and long-stay listings with the moderating effects of "room type" and "review score" in Amsterdam, Tokyo, and London. The analysis was conducted using linear regression models to predict the price of listings based on the stay length short or long. The results of the analysis are presented below.

## Pricing analysis

```{r Mean prices, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
price <- read_csv("../../output/pricing_results.csv")
kable(price)
```
Disregarding room type and review scores, our analysis showed a marked difference in average pricing between short-term and long-term listings. In both Amsterdam and Tokyo, short-term stays exhibited a higher average price point compared to their long-term counterparts. Interestingly, London demonstrated an inverse trend, with long-term listings being generally more expensive.

## Linear regression results
### Explaining Variation in listing prices in Amsterdam

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ams_results <- read_csv("../../output/Amsterdam_lr_results.csv")
kable(ams_results)
```

Before interpreting the results it is good to establish a the baseline of the variables
Stay_type_dummy = 0 (long-stay), room_type =  "Entire home/apt", and review_scores_rating = 0 (max 5). Furthermore, the analysis will hold a 5% significance level. The main effect stay_type_dummy on the price suggests that on average a "long-stay" in 129 Euro lower than "short-stay". However, since the p-value (0.08)>0.05 this shows a marginally significant effect. Therefore, It can be concluded with 95% statistical confidence that duration of stay (short vs. long) does not differ much in price. 

In contrast there are three variable that are statistically significant with a confidence level of 95%.

* **room_typeHotel room:** On average, a hotel room is priced 736 Euro lower in comparison to an entire home/apt (p-value = 0.0156).

* **stay_type_dummy * review_scores_rating:** The effect of "review_scores_rating" on price is different for "long-stay" listings compared to "short-stay". For "long-stay" listings, a one star increase in "review_scores_rating" is associated with a 32.4 Euro increase in price. This shows the moderation effect of reviews on the relationship between price and stay_type is significant (p-value = 0.0329)

* **room_typeHotel room * review_scores_rating:** For hotel rooms, a one review increase in "review_scores_rating" leads to an additional increase in price by 139 Euro, compared to the baseline ‘Entire home/apt’. The shows the moderating effect of reviews on the relationship between hotel rooms and price is significant (p-value = 0.0315) .

Analysis of the Amsterdam listings reveals a lack of long-stay accommodations within the hotel and shared room categories. Consequently, coefficients for the interaction terms "long-stay", "hotel room", and "shared room" are necessarily represented as NA (not available). This aligns with the established short-term nature of  hotel and shared room listings, which typically lack a 7-day minimum stay requirement.

### Explaining Variation in listing prices in Tokyo

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tyo_results <- read_csv("../../output/Tokyo_lr_results.csv")
kable(tyo_results)
```

As for the Airbnb listings in Tokyo, the baseline and significance level remains similar to Amsterdam. The main effect stay_type_dummy on the price suggests that on average a ‘long-stay’ in 33620 Yen lower than ‘short-stay’. Since the p-value (0.00653) < 0.05 this implies that there is a significant difference in price between the listing with a short_stay vs long_stay in Tokyo.

Despite the lack of significance in the majority of the terms. The interaction between 
stay_type_dummy * review_scores_rating is significant. It implies that effect of "review_scores_rating" on price is different for "long-stay" listings compared to "short-stay". For "long-stay" listings, a one star increase in "review_scores_rating" is associated with a 7321 Yen increase in price. This shows the moderation effect of reviews on the relationship between price and stay_type is significant (p-value = 0.00515) 

Like Amsterdam, Tokyo hotels listed on the platform primarily offer short-term stays. This lack of long-stay options prevents us from analyzing the interaction between "long-stay" and "hotel room" variables

### Explaining Variation in listing prices in London

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ldn_results <- read_csv("../../output/London_lr_results.csv")
kable(ldn_results)
```

Finally, the London Airbnb listings will be treated with the same baseline and significance level (5%). The main effect stay_type_dummy on the price suggests that on average a ‘long-stay’ is 56.8 Pounds lower than ‘short-stay’. Since the p-value (0.0000124) < 0.05 this implies that there is a significant difference in price between the listing with a short_stay vs long_stay in London.

In addition there are 5 terms that are statisically significant with a confidence level of 95%.

* **“room_typePrivate room”:** On average, a private room is priced 147 Pounds lower in comparsion to an entire home/apt (p-value = 0.000000000116).

* **“stay_type_dummy * room_typePrivate room”:** On average when a listing is a long stay in a private room in comparison to short stay in an entire home/apt , the first option is 91.3 Pounds more in the listing price (p-value = 0.0001.51)

* **“stay_type_dummy * room_typeShared room”:** Similarly, on average when a listing is a long stay in a shared room in comparison to short stay in an entire home/apt , the first option is 277 Pounds more in the listing price. Evidently, the moderating effect of shared room on the relationship between price and stay_type is significant (p-value = 0.00843).

* **“stay_type_dummy * review_score_rating”:** The effect of "review_scores_rating" on price is different for "long-stay" listings compared to "short-stay". For "long-stay" listings, an one star increase in "review_scores_rating" is associated with an average 11.8 Pounds increase in price. This shows the moderation effect of reviews on the relationship between price and stay_type is significant (p-value = 0.0000117)

* **“stay_type_dummy * room_typePrivate room * review_scores_rating”:** On average when a listing is a long stay in a private room in comparison to short stay in an entire home/apt , and the review increase by one star it would decrease the listing price by 16.8 Pounds. Indicating that the moderating effect of private room and review score has a significant negative effect on the relationship between stay type and price (p-value = 0.000998). 

In contrast to listings located in Amsterdam and Tokyo, hotel and shared room options do long-term stay opportunities. However,  graphical representations of the data underlines the limited availability of such listings. While some listing data exists within these categories, the analysis suggests that they do not exert a statistically significant impact on the main effect.
