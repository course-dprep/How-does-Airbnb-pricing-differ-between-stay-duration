# Airbnb data preparation

Are there any noticeable differences in pricing between short-term (e.g., minimum nights < 7) and long-term (e.g., minimum nights >= 7) rental options?

## Motivation

Airbnb often face the challenge of optimizing their pricing strategies to maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market. 
One common distinction in the industry is between short-term rentals (typically with a minimum stay of fewer than 7 nights) and long-term rentals (with a minimum stay of 7 nights or more).
Understanding the nuances of pricing strategies for these two categories can be crucial for businesses to make informed decisions and enhance their overall financial performance.
